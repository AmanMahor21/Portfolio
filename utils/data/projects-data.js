The backend follows a clean, class-based architecture with separate layers for models, services, repositories, and controllers, making the code well-structured and easy to maintain. Iâ€™ve used MySQL as the database and integrated it using TypeORM, along with Routing Controllers for clear and organized API routing. Key features of the project include dynamic product listing pages, JWT-based authentication, and Google OAuth2 login. ",
